# Paint-Clone
Paint-Clone is a small learning project where we aim to incorporate various methods and techniques. Among other things, we want to improve our collaboration in a small team using Git, gain more confidence, and test our abilities to apply the knowledge we have learned

As a build tool, we are utilizing Maven. We find it particularly beneficial to familiarize ourselves with such tools, especially as some team members lack experience with build tools. For our development, we are using the Java SDK 21 due to its Long-Term Support (LTS) feature.
